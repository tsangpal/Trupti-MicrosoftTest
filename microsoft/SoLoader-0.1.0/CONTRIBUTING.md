## Our Development Process
Each pull request is first submitted into Facebook's internal repositories.
Once the commit has successfully passed Facebook's internal test suite, it will
be exported back out from Facebook's repository. We endeavour to do this as soon
as possible for all commits.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
