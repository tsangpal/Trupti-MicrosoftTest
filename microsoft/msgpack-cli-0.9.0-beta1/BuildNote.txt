How to Build Help Files
  1. Open "MsgPack.shfbproj" with SandCastle Help File Builder.
  2. Build it.
  3. Copy contents under `Help/` directory to `apidoc/` of `gh-pages` branch without `*.chm` files.
  4. Rename `index.html` to `top.html` because gh-pages does not allow index.* file.
  5. Remove other `index.*` files.
  6. Copy `*.chm` files to `dist/` of `gh-pages` branch.
