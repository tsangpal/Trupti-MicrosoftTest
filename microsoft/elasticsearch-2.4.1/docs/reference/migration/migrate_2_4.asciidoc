=== Settings

The setting `bootstrap.mlockall` has been renamed to
<<bootstrap.memory_lock,`bootstrap.memory_lock`>>. Future versions of
Elasticsearch will refuse to start if `bootstrap.mlockall` is set. You
can switch to the new setting now.

=== Query DSL

The `optimize_bbox` parameter for `geo_distance` and `geo_distance_range` queries
has been deprecated when querying indexes created after 2.1.
